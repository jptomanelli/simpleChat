# SimpleChat

This is currently being built and is not functional yet. The idea so far is that you can choose between two modes. The first would be where you signup and can communicate one-on-one with friends in your friend list. The second option is to communicate in group chatrooms where you would need to know a chatroom's name and have the correct key to be able to decrypt messages.
