# SimpleChat

## Notes

The general idea is that you'll choose whether you'd like to create a tmp username and join a chatroom or signin and talk one-on-one from a friendlist. Right now I'm focusing on the anon chatrooms and then will move on the the latter. Once I have the basic functionality down in the browser, I will then work to move everything over to electron to make it a desktop application. 

### Todo :

#### Design
- [ ] Friend-list
- [ ] Add friend?
- [ ] Group chat - How would this work and still be secure?

#### FrontEnd
- [ ] Homepage
- [ ] Try new Crypto API
- [ ] Electron to communicate using sockets
- [ ] Move design over to electron

#### DB
- [ ] Choose/setup Database
- [ ] Users Store in DB
- [ ] Store messages in DB
